                        Hi there! First of all, thanks for checking out my
                        portfolio.
                        <p />
                        My strongest skills are bringing energy into a team,
                        finding more efficient ways to carry out repetitive
                        tasks and thinking of creative solutions to a problem.
                        Outside of the workplace, you'll find me at the gym,
                        practising karate, solving rubik's cubes and learning
                        something new.
                        <p />
                        I've finally found my passion after three careers. I'm
                        driven to become a full stack developer and do the best
                        work of my life. This career will offer me a place where
                        I'll never master my role and be continually learning
                        new technologies and stacks as the industry evolves.
                        <p />
                        At the moment I'm working in Technical Support for Xero
                        and have completed a developer bootcamp at Enspiral Dev
                        Academy. I'm eager to share my knowledge with my future
                        team and learn from the best developers in the industry.{" "}
                        <p />
                        <p />I will bring a great customer awareness and quality
                        of life focus to your team. I love thinking of big
                        outside the box ideas and presenting in front of an
                        audience. I'll frequently get drinks or do dishes for my
                        team to set a good example of how a team should look
                        after one another. I value honesty, caring for others,
                        hard work and timeliness.

                      <div class="content">
                        During my time at DevAcademy I decided to do a
                        reflection at the halfway point to see how far I've
                        grown in a short amount of time.
                        <p />
                        Compared to my portfolio website pre-bootcamp, I'm proud
                        to say I spent much less time on this website and
                        achieved an outcome that exceeded my expectations.
                        <p />
                        I've included more details about my reflections in the
                        readme over on GitHub (
                        <a href="https://github.com/leslie-alldridge/personal-blog-react-rebuild">
                          here
                        </a>
                        ) This website is powered by the following technologies:
                        <ul>
                          <li> React</li>
                          <li> Bulma CSS</li>
                          <li> React Parallax</li>
                          <li> CSS 3 Animations</li>
                          <li> Node JS</li>
                          <li> Webpack</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          If you have any questions about the technologies used
                          or want to learn how I developed certain parts of this
                          page, please let me know.
                          <p />

                          For anyone looking at this page thinking "Wow, how'd
                          he do that?", drop me a message or email and I'll be
                          in touch.

                          projects and blogs.
